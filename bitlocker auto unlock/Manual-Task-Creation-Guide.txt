   - Click "OK" to save

8. TEST THE TASK
   - Right-click on your new task
   - Select "Run"
   - BitLocker Manager should start

TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============

If you get permission errors:
- Make sure you're logged in as an Administrator
- Try running Task Scheduler as Administrator (right-click taskschd.msc -> Run as administrator)

If the task doesn't appear in the list:
- Check the "Task Scheduler Library" folder
- Look for any error messages in the Task Scheduler

If the task runs but the program doesn't start:
- Verify the path to BitLockerManager.exe is correct
- Make sure the "Start in" directory is set correctly
- Check Windows Event Viewer for error messages

ALTERNATIVE STARTUP METHODS:
===========================

If Task Scheduler doesn't work, you can use these alternatives:

1. STARTUP FOLDER
   - Press Win + R, type: shell:startup
   - Create a shortcut to BitLockerManager.exe in this folder

2. REGISTRY RUN KEY
   - Press Win + R, type: regedit
   - Navigate to: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
   - Create new String Value: "BitLockerAutoUnlock"
   - Set value to full path of BitLockerManager.exe

3. GROUP POLICY (if available)
   - Press Win + R, type: gpedit.msc
   - Navigate to: User Configuration > Windows Settings > Scripts (Logon/Logoff)
   - Add BitLockerManager.exe to Logon scripts
